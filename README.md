# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Recipe
Recipe Management website
Programming Languages:

HTML/CSS: For building the structure and styling of your web pages.
JavaScript: To add interactivity to the site and create a responsive user interface.

Relational Database: You can use databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite for storing recipe data, user information, and comments.
NoSQL Database: Optionally, consider using a NoSQL database like MongoDB to store unstructured data, such as user profiles or user-generated content.

Recipe APIs: You can integrate recipe APIs like Edamam or Spoonacular to access a vast database of recipes. This can save you time on manually adding recipes to your site.
Authentication APIs: Implement user authentication using services like OAuth (Google, Facebook, etc.) for user registration and login.

Authentication: Implement user registration and login using libraries like Passport.js or the built-in authentication systems provided by your chosen web framework.
Security: Ensure secure data transmission (HTTPS) and implement security practices to protect user data, like input validation and authentication middleware.

You can use Docker to containerize your application, making it easier to deploy and manage across different environments.

Implement SEO best practices to ensure your recipe sharing site is discoverable by search engines. Tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console can help with this.
